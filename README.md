What challenges did you face when refactoring your code to use Bootstrap? :Mistaken with already existing css styling. Refactoring required testing responsiveness across breakpoints (sm, md, lg, etc.) and updating layouts accordingly. HTML files became more cluttered with utility classes, making them harder to read without good structure or consistent naming. Need more time to get familiar with the differrent elements.

How did using Bootstrap utility classes and components simplify your styling process?I could rapidly build layouts using container, row, col, btn, card, etc., without writing new CSS.Built-in classes like text-center, bg-light, shadow, and rounded provided a consistent visual style across components.Responsiveness Made Easy: Utilities like d-md-flex, flex-column, col-lg-6, and mt-3 mt-md-0 handled mobile vs desktop views seamlessly Much of the styling was achieved purely with class names, cutting down the amount of custom CSS drastically.

In what scenarios might you choose not to use Bootstrap and write custom CSS instead?If a project requires a custom look and feel (e.g., specific typography, layout, or design tokens), Bootstrap’s generic styles might be limiting. For small pages or components, using only the required CSS avoids importing the full Bootstrap library.For rich animations or fine control over interactive states, custom CSS or JS may be better suited than Bootstrap’s default behavior.
